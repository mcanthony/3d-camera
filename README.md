3d-camera
=========
An easy-to-use 3D camera for real-time interactive graphical applications.

# Example

```javascript
var createCamera = require('3d-camera')

```

# Install

```
npm i 3d-camera
```

# API

## Constructor

#### `var camera = require('3d-camera')([options])`


## Basic interface

Updates to the camera state are synchronized at calls to `tick()`.  This is necessary to ensure that camera state is smoothly interpolated between successive updates.  

#### `camera.tick()`
**This must be called at the start of each frame**.  It applies any pending updates to the camera and performs interpolation between previous camera motions.

**Returns** `true` if the state of the camera changed since the last call to `tick()`, `false` if the camera is at a steady state.

#### `camera.width`
This is the width of the view port which is being rendered.

#### `camera.height`
This is the height of the view port which is being rendered.

#### `camera.shape`
As an alternative to directly accessing the width/height properties, it is also possible to access the shape of the camera viewport directly as a vector.  For some applications this may be more convenient.

#### `camera.delay`
The amount of delay to apply to the camera when interpolating between previous states.  This delay is applied in millisecond and is based on the wall clock time.  No delay means that camera updates are not smoothed.

## Coordinate transformations

The main function of the camera is to keep track of coordinate transformations.  By convention, in computer graphics we define 4 coordinate systems:

* **Data coordinates**: Which are the coordinates where the geometry to be rendered is defined
* **World coordinates**: Which is a common coordinate system in which all objects are rendered
* **Camera coordinates**: A coordinate system in the world with the camera at the center
* **Clip coordinates**: The normalized device coordinates 

These coordinate transformations are generated by 3 different matrices which transform each coordinate system to the next:

* **Model matrix**: *Data* -> *World*
* **View matrix**: *World* -> *Camera*
* **Projection matrix**: *Camera* -> *Clip*

Coordinate transformation updates are synchronized on calls to `tick()`, so any changes to these matrices have to wait until the next call to `tick()` before they become visible.

### Compound transformations

```javascript
```

### Projection matrix

```javascript
var projection = camera.projection
```

#### `projection.matrix`

#### `projection.mode`

#### `projection.fovX`

#### `projection.fovY`

#### `projection.zNear`

#### `projection.zFar`

### View matrix

```javascript
var view = camera.view
```

#### `view.matrix`

#### `view.mode`

#### `view.up`

#### `view.center`

#### `view.eye`

#### `view.distance`

#### `view.lookAt(eye, center, up)`

#### `view.rotate(dx, dy)`

#### `view.pan(dx, dy)`

#### `view.zoom(dr)`



### Model matrix

```javascript
var model = camera.model
```

#### `model.matrix`

#### `model.mode`
